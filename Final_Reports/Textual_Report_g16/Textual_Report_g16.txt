{user_story_11_AND_user_story_25}
  
Redundants elements are: 
* Primary Action: have
* Primary Entity: repository
* Targets: Link from "have" to "repository" is found.

 user_story_25: #g16# as a digitalrecords archivist, i want to #have# the #repository# to lift embargoes on the release date and set the access controls to the configuration set on item on that date.
