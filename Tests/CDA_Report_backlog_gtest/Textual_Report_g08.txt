 user_story_01: #g08# as a developer, i want to #get# a #data# package# into node, so that i can #start using# the #data# for #doing# #analysis# and #visualizations#.

 user_story_14: #g08# as a developer, i want to #get# a #data# package# into python in seconds, so that i can #start using# the #data# for #doing# #analysis# and #visualizations#.

The following sentence parts are candidates for possible redundancies between user stories:

user_story_01:  i want to #get# a #data# package# into node
user_story_01:  so that i can #start using# the #data# for #doing# #analysis# and #visualizations#.
user_story_14:  i want to #get# a #data# package# into python in seconds
user_story_14:  so that i can #start using# the #data# for #doing# #analysis# and #visualizations#.
