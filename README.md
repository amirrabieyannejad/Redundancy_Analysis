# Redundancy Analysis
Our system initiates with backlogs annotated with [Doccano tool](https://github.com/ace-design/nlp-stories) generated by Mosser et al. as the primary input. These annotated USs are used to generate `graph transformation rules` for each US in the backlog using [Henshin](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Henshin/Compact_API) tool.

Subsequently, these rules serve as inputs for the Henshin [Conflict and Dependency Analysis](https://wiki.eclipse.org/Henshin/Conflict_and_Dependency_Analysis) (CDA) tool , which automates the identification of potentially redundant US pairs. The output from the CDA tool is then utilized to create a report that compiles information on these potentially redundant pairs. This report, in turn, becomes the input for the evaluation process, which outputs statistical data concerning redundancy among USs.
Following Figure illustrates how each step in this sequence is interconnected, with the output of one step feeding directly into the next. This diagram effectively demonstrates the toolchain and process workflow, highlighting how each tool transforms artefacts and contributes to the overall objective of redundancy detection.

## US labelling in JSON files
As the annotated USs in the JSON files do not contain identifiers, a  [customised Python script](https://github.com/amirrabieyannejad/USs_Annotation/tree/main/Skript/nummerize_us), is used to assign an unique identifier to each US, which is stored in a JSON object named `US_Nr`
## Gathering all Extracted report using VBa
In order to evalute the extracte reports from 19 datasets, we use a [VBa acript](https://github.com/amirrabieyannejad/USs_Annotation/tree/main/Skript/extractFromJSONFiles) which read the extracted information from JSON-report and gather the information like `PID`, `user story pair`, `Text of user story pair`, `Main/Benefit/Total Redundancy Clauses`, and assessing the main/benefit part of user stories as `full` or `partial` `redundant`.
